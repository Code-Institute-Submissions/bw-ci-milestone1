# Olympus Fitness - Responsive site for a gym business. 

For my project in the User Centered Frontend Design module I have chosen to do a website for a fake gym business. As a gym enthusiast myself, I had a fair idea of what content such site needs which made a project easier. I have focused on making a user friendly website that tells potential client all the information he may need and also makes a new customer excited to visit the gym and see it for himself. 
My personal goal when designing this website was to heavily alter and edit existing bootstrap  components. I wanted use this project as a learning tool predominantly to improve my little knowledge of bootstrap and semantic HTML.

## UX  - User Experience Design

### User stories

    #### *User Goals*
    Owner's - To attract new customers by giving them enough information about what does the business offer and what makes it different than others as well as provide quick information to existing customers such as opening times and offers.
    New Customer - To find out what is on offer at Olympus Fitness. Have a look at how does the gym look, where is it located and its opening hours. I would also like to be able to contact the gym online.
    Existing Customer - I want to be able to check the opening times of the gym and contact staff with any queries I have.

    #### Solution

    These goals are accomplished by designing a website that will be easy to navigate and rich in information. The information has to well presented to not confuse the customer. This is done by creating sections on the website that aim to give information about the gym, it's membership options, its contact information and opening times. Additional features are the gallery and social links that aim to help the owner interact with the customers. An easy to use, simple form that allows user to ask a question in a matter of minutes is also designed and placed conveniently in the contact page.

#### Images

All the images used in the project apart from the Logo image were taken from https://www.pexels.com . Those images are free to use and edit.
The image used for the logo was taken from https://pixabay.com/illustrations/gym-weight-loss-muscle-exercise-1048852/ and edited by me to suit the color scheme of the website.
#### Code

When browsing the website on mobile the offer.html page contains More Info buttons that display the content onClick. This was created using custom JavaScript. I have used [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32153720/how-to-make-button-show-content-onclick) stack overflow question to get an idea how to accomplish this task and edited the code to suit my needs to the best of my ability.
